Make a CLIP or FastSAM application on gradio/spaces using open-source models. 
- You may use the open source pre-trained models for CLIP or FastSAM

### Implementation and Results:
Implemented a simple gradio interface on higgingface and Github. Used a pretrained CLIP model from https://github.com/openai/CLIP. Model has been pretrained on Coco Dataset
