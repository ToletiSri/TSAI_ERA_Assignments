Assignment-21
Refer to this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=2s&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) and train your gpt model. Port this huggingface spaces

### Implementation and Results:
Trained the GPT model as per Andrej Karapathy's instructions in [GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture)

There are 2 notebooks in this repo:

S21 - Jupyter notebook that has been used to train the model, also prints a Shakespeare like text after training during inferencing.

GradioInterface - A simple gradio interface that accepts a text and length, and generates shakespeare like test starting with the given text and given size

#### Results:
"Officious, and the people of the fire;
And him with his virtuous natural words;
The sword of a parageit and confirmate
Where it had our courtesy: nor my garms should we,
For shame, but defy him-shamed with the gentle hours
That sweet's infant; and so retoris as it glow,
To help misforthy, every known, which shows
In commissingly strength; for near nature wears, each in
joy.
I am enten'd to no good fellow, health I wear:
Ah, tell-my mother may stone return to me;
And leave me have this country'd 
"
